This is a BROUILLON for everyone.

## Usage

Enter [Open Location Code](https://plus.codes/) values ("plus codes") in the center and branch inputs of `index.html`. The page draws draggable branches from the center node and displays the distance between the center and each branch when valid plus codes are provided.

Example full plus code for the Eiffel Tower: `8FW4V75V+8Q`.
